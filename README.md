# Analysis_of_single_cell_data_for_Usp22_project

The analysis pipeline can be run to reproduce the results of the scRNA-seq analysis in our manuscript.
Data required to run the analysis will be made available as soon as the manuscript is published.

To run the pipeline, download all files into the working directory of a new R-Project. 
Run the first section of the main.R file until all depencies are installed and R is restarted.
Before running the rest of the main.R file, adjust the paths to the data and insert the name of the output folder which will be created by the script.
Afterwards run the rest of the main.R script and the complete pipeline should be executed automatically.
There is no need to manually run any other script.
Make sure that your computer remains connected to the internet while running the pipeline as some functions connect to databases.
